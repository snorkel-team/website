## What is Doks?

Doks is Jekyll theme created for project documentations.
You can use it with [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab Pages](https://gitlab.com) as well as a standalone project.

## What is Jekyll?

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favourite web server.

## Install Jekyll

### Requirements

Installing Jekyll should be straight-forward if all requirements are met. Before you start, make sure your system has the following:

- GNU/Linux, Unix, or macOS
- Ruby version 2.0 or above, including all development headers
- RubyGems
- GCC and Make (in case your system doesn’t have them installed, which you can check by running `gcc -v` and `make -v` in your system’s command line interface)

### Install with RubyGems

The best way to install Jekyll is via RubyGems. At the terminal prompt, simply run the following command to install Jekyll:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

All of Jekyll’s gem dependencies are automatically installed by the above command, so you won’t have to worry about them at all.
